<p class="justify">This was my baby for more than a year. It was a service that allowed tabletop gamers to create custom digital representations of their characters to share online and 3D print for their live games. I put up a Kickstarter, was contacted by another company doing a similar thing and was aqui-hired.<p>

<p class="justify">Just before we launched our new campaign a California based team put up a damn-near identical product with a full prototype and big names like South Park Studios and Naughty Dog behind them. They made almost 400k. Sigh. But I'm gratified the idea is out there now and that my idea was validated in such a big way.</p>
