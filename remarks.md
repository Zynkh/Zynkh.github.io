<p class="justify">This was my mid-term project at the Lighthouse Labs web development bootcamp, completed in 3 days with 2 other team members using Sinatra. I thought it would be cool to create an app where an english teacher could get his students to post their essays for group feedback and easy marking. This is a reasonable version 1, though there are a few bugs. Not bad for having 0 coding experience 4 weeks previous.</p>
