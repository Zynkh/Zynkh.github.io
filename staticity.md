<p class="justify">This was my final project at the Lighthouse Labs development bootcamp, completed in 14 days with 3 other team members. I had always wanted to build an app that compared cities on livability metrics, and the team liked the idea, so we went for it. We really wanted a robust back end but with special attention paid to a beautiful front end experience, responsive on all screen sizes.</p>

<p class="justify">We built this app in Ruby on Rails, using plenty of javascript, including jquery and D3 for the charts. We sourced from API's and created our own that our users could access, and included a form where a user could contribute to our database.</p>
