<p class="justify">A short film I produced at VFS. We had a team of over 50 people and the output is quite visually stunning for a student film. I seem to have misplaced my copy of the whole film, but til I find it, here's the teaser that was put on youtube. This project was to get us hands-on experience with concept development, hiring and casting, pitching, money-raising, project management and a million other little things that have to go into a film before it's watchable.</p>
