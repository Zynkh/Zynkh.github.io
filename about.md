<p class="justify">I'm looking to join a great team as a junior web developer. I want to eventually be true full stack, though my aptitude right now favours front end. I love the "architect" part of a project and I'm very good at the 10,000 foot view, taking user psychology and business strategy into consideration to fully map out whatever I'm working on, then figuring out what's needed and how everything will fit together. I also really enjoy troubleshooting and figuring out solutions to those weird problems you run into.</p>

<p class="justify">The first part of my career was spent doing short-term contracts in animation, video games, film production, general design and experiential marketing. If an opportunity came up that didn't perfectly match my skill set, I went for it anyway and learned what I needed on the fly, and thus I have a solid grasp of every aspect of project production. I've become pretty good at bringing together different skill sets and greasing the wheels so they can all get along and work together effectively.</p>

<p class="justify">I successfully sold my last project (a 3D printing company that catered to tabletop gamers) and currently run a small business that pays my bills and takes very little time out of my week, so I am looking for full time employment in web development.</p>

<p class="justify">I'm hugely excited by science, technology and the prospects of the future. I love games, especially tabletop games like D&D and my shelves are full of sci-fi and fantasy novels. I dream big and want to use every skill and resource at my disposal to make a difference in the world and change it for the better.
